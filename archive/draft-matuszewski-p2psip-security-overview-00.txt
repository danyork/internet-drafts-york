Abstract

   This document provides a security overview and analysis for the Peer-
   to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) overlay network.  It
   discusses security threats for the P2PSIP architecture and its
   components.  It compares security difference between client/server
   (C/S) and P2P implementations of SIP, and then partitions the P2PSIP
   architecture into layers and analyzes the security issues in each
   layer and the security relationship among the layers.

Internet-Draft          P2PSIP Security Overview          September 2009


1.  Introduction

   The scope of this document is to analyze security threats concerning
   a P2PSIP overlay architecture as described in the concepts and
   terminology for P2PSIP document [I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts] .  It
   presents an introduction to security threats to P2PSIP environments
   and then compares security difference between client/server (C/S) and
   P2P implementations of SIP, and then partitions the P2PSIP
   architecture into layers and analyzes the security issues in each
   layer and the security relationship among the layers.  This draft
   also classifies the application scenarios into two main types and
   then analyzes in detail the security threats with these two types of
   scenarios.  Some solutions to certain attacks are given as an example
   in the analysis text.  In the end, it provides user and system
   security considerations for the P2PSIP overlay network.  This
   document is designed to complement the P2PSIP Protocol Framework and
   Requirements document [I-D.bryan-p2psip-requirements].

2.  Terminology

   We use the terminology and definitions from the Concepts and
   Terminology for Peer to Peer SIP [I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts] draft
   extensively in this document.  Other terms used in this document are
   defined inline when used and are also defined below for reference.

   O P2PSIP Network Entity: A P2PSIP network entity is a peer, client,
   or other functional node that may become a part of a P2PSIP overlay.

   O P2PSIP System: A P2PSIP system consists of the P2PSIP overlay as
   defined in [I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts] and one or more enrollment
   servers.  The enrollment servers issue unique identities and
   credentials that are used to authenticate and admit P2PSIP network
   entities to the overlay and allow a user to use services provided by
   the P2PSIP overlay.  The enrollment server may also provide an
   initial set of bootstrap nodes.

   O P2P Overlay Base: A P2P Overlay Base includes all the Peers that
   participate in the p2p overlay.  The P2P Overlay Base provides
   distributed storage and routing services to both peers and clients.

   O Trusted P2P Overlay Base: All peers in a Trusted P2P Overlay Base
   are trusted.  The Peers in the overlay are all of good behaviors and
   under control due to deployment.  For example, a carrier deploys a
   Trusted P2P Overlay Base to provide service to his customers, and all
   the peers are the carrier's devices.

   O Untrusted P2P Overlay Base: Peers in a Untrusted P2P Overlay Base
   are not all trusted.  There may exist some malicious behaving nodes
   in the P2P Overlay Base.

3.  Security threats

   This section analyses security threats in the Peer-to-Peer SIP
   architecture.

3.1.  Replay Attacks

   Replay attacks are a form of network attacks where a valid data
   transmission is repeated or delayed.  A badly behaving node may take
   an older message sent by another node, resend it to the overlay, and
   thus replace any newer data with the old information present in this
   message.  During those procedures, an attacker may be able to enroll
   credentials for himself, or replace existing entry in the P2PSIP
   overlay by an older entry.  Thus, the architecture must consider this
   issue in the process of both enrollment and modification of P2PSIP
   resource (user) records in a P2PSIP overlay.

   This is especially applicable to P2PSIP overlays that use the
   recursive routing mode.  In the recursive routing mode, data sent in
   a PUT request traverses many peers in the overlay.  If there is no
   protection against the replay attacks any peer that forwards the
   request may store a copy of the request and resend the captured
   request corrupting data stored in the overlay.

3.2.  Message Insertion, Modification, Deletion

   The message insertion, modification, and deletion attacks are where
   an attacker is able to alter the messages being exchanged between two
   end points.

   P2PSIP peers connect to other peers to form the P2PSIP overlay
   network.  Typically peers provide storage, routing and bootstrap
   services for other peers and clients.  They allow P2PSIP entities to
   PUT information to or GET information from the P2PSIP overlay
   network.  In the P2PSIP overlay that allows for a recursive routing,
   peers are responsible for forwarding messages (requests and
   responses) received from P2PSIP network entities to other peers.
   Depending on the size of the overlay a single message can be
   forwarded by many peers before it reaches a destination.  In the
   iterative routing peers are responsible for redirecting the requests
   to other peers.  They do not forward the requests to other peers.
   They respond to a request originator with an address of a peer that
   should be contacted in the next step.  In such an environment a badly
   behaving peer may:

   o  modify incoming messages,





Song, et al.              Expires April 1, 2010                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          P2PSIP Security Overview          September 2009


   o  discard incoming messages (the peer can discard requests and
      responses it is supposed to forward),

   o  generate incorrect responses to requests that are directed to some
      other nodes.

   The first bullet point describes the attack that allows the peer to
   cause the overlay to store unauthorized or outdated information in
   the resource (user) records or return corrupted data to the
   originator of the GET request (a peer or client).  The peer may
   change the data record in the overlay by changing incoming PUT
   messages or modify result of the GET operation by modifying incoming
   GET responses.  With this type of attack the integrity of the P2PSIP
   system can become compromised.

   The middle bullet point is related not only to attacks that allow a
   malicious peer to prevent access to a P2PSIP resource (user) record,
   but also to attacks that can degrade the performance of the P2PSIP
   system making it useless from the end-user perspective.  The second
   problem is of high importance in P2PSIP overlays that store user's
   reachability data which is much more time-critical than content
   stored in file sharing networks.

   The attack described in the last bullet above may lead to a requestor
   receiving corrupted data e.g. a connectivity information that points
   to some other node.  This may happen if a malicious peer can respond
   to incoming requests that are directed to another peer.

   Besides peers may act as relays relaying traffic between two P2PSIP
   network entities or act as a SIP proxy and a SIP registrar.
   Providing those services a malicious peer may perform a similar
   attacks as described above.  Let us consider the following deployment
   scenario where some peers act as SIP registrars or/and SIP proxies
   and allow a conventional SIP UA to access resources of the P2PSIP
   overlay network.  An unmodified SIP UA sends an SIP Invite request
   towards an unknown peer that acts as a SIP proxy.  If the SIP
   messages are not cryptographically protected, this peer may act
   maliciously and proxy a request to other than intended node or modify
   SDP messages in order to stay on the media path.  Similarly a peer
   that acts as a SIP Registrar may modify registration information
   before it sends it to a peer that is responsible for storing the
   P2PSIP user record of a registering SIP UA.  Those attacks do not
   have impact on the integrity of the overlay.  Nevertheless those
   attacks must be addressed by designers of service specific protocols
   such as SIP [RFC3261].

Internet-Draft          P2PSIP Security Overview          September 2009


3.3.  Man-In-The-Middle

   In man-in-the-middle (m-i-m) attacks a malicious node can hijack a
   connection established between two legitimate nodes, or just listen
   and/or modify messages exchanged between two nodes.  In contrast to
   the attacks presented in Section 13.2 man-in-the middle attacks are
   prevalent in pairing and authentication procedures.

   The m-i-m threat can be mitigated by using well-established
   authentication protocols.  The authentication protocols may be used
   to verify if a certain P2PSIP entity is the entity it claims to be,
   for example if it is really a peer that is identified by a certain
   peer ID.  The authentication protocols can also be used to verify if
   a particular P2PSIP entity belongs to a particular overlay or not.
   However, authentication protocols cannot fully mitigate all of the
   attacks presented in Section 13.2.  There can be malicious peers that
   are authorized overlay participants with a particular peer
   identifiers.

   If a bootstrap process is fully decentralized and a bootstrap node is
   not trusted or authentication of the bootstrap node is not possible,
   then the joining node can easily be attacked, e.g. it may be
   redirected to another overlay or a part of the legacy overlay that is
   controlled by the attacker.  However if it is possible to
   authenticate a particular peer in the overlay the joining peer may
   use P2P specific mechanisms to detect if it is redirected to the
   right overlay or the right place in the overlay.

   Conventional SIP proxy and SIP registrars are servers maintained by a
   service provider.  If a user trust a service provider he also trusts
   servers the service provider maintains.  In P2PSIP SIP proxies and
   registrars can be maintained by users themselves (they can be
   collocated with peers).  In a distributed environment it is very
   difficult to trust all of peers in the overlay.  Without an efficient
   verification mechanism that allows to verify which peers are be
   trusted, peers that act as SIP proxies and registrars may easily
   perform m-i-m attacks.  The problem must be solved by SIP designers
   as well as by the P2PSIP community.

3.4.  Offline Cryptographic Attacks

   The incentive to break a secure system dominates the effort to do so.
   It is likely that P2PSIP systems do not pose a likely target for
   attacks, and if state-of-the art security methods are used, the
   needed effort to break the system by breaking cryptography is very
   likely to be higher than by finding and exploiting software errors
   and vulnerabilities.

Internet-Draft          P2PSIP Security Overview          September 2009


3.5.  Unauthorized Usage

   The basic notions of authentication and authorization, when
   implemented correctly and consistently should protect against
   unauthorized usage of the P2PSIP system.  However, the
   trustworthiness of an identity may be weak i.e. the enrollment system
   might be fairly open and allow devices and persons that wish to
   attack the system.  Thus, there is a significant threat of attacks
   from within the system.

   A malicious peer may do a multitude of attacks towards the overlay
   including:

   o  ignoring, changing, and deleting records in DHT that is it
      responsible for,

   o  misbehaving during data lookups (ie, giving wrong node addresses,
      discarding queries).

   The first bullet point is related to attacks that may cause DHT to
   contain unauthorized, outdated information and/or miss information
   about users or resources.  Each peer is responsible for a part of the
   hash space.  Peers store resource (user) records that fall into their
   part of the hash space.  A malicious peer may modify or delete
   resource (user) records it is supposed to store.  It may also reply
   with incorrect information to the GET requests addressed to resource
   (user) records it is responsible for.  In addition it may ignore any
   record updates.  These attacks are not limited to peers that are
   responsible for primary copies of resource (user) records.  They are
   also related to peers that store replicas of resource (user) records.
   Besides a bootstrap node may also respond with wrong bootstrapping
   information.

   The second bullet point addresses attacks that may impact correctness
   of routing mechanisms.  If the recursive routing is used a malicious
   peer can forward messages to another malicious node rather than
   forwarding the messages according to the legitimate routing
   information.  This may also impact the iterative routing being
   corrupted when the peer redirects the requester to a malicious node.

3.6.  Inappropriate Usage

   The P2PSIP overlay essentially provides a distributed storage for
   P2PSIP resource (user) records.  The data stored in the distributed
   database can be used in an inappropriate manner.  If there is no
   access control to a resource (user) records stored in the overlay and
   any node can update or retrieve information stored in the overlay.
   An attacker may request data stored in the P2PSIP resource (user)



Song, et al.              Expires April 1, 2010                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft          P2PSIP Security Overview          September 2009


   records and perform inappropriate usage attacks.  Besides the
   attacker may also update entries of other users or resources.

   The individual services provided by P2PSIP (messaging, real-time
   communication) have their respective threat models regarding
   inappropriate use (Spam, viruses, ...) but these can be considered
   out of scope for this document.

3.7.  Denial of Service

   In the P2PSIP architecture [I-D.ietf-p2psip-concepts], the P2PSIP
   resource (user) records are not maintained in a central, trustworthy
   storage system, rather they are distributed among peers participating
   in the system.  Routing, relaying, SIP proxy and registrar services
   are also distributed among P2PSIP entities.  In cases where
   authentication in the P2PSIP overlay is weak or where the system is
   fairly open to new participants the "infiltration" is trivial (e.g.,
   Sybil attack).

   If peers in the P2PSIP overlay can freely choose peer IDs or/and
   easily modify previously selected peer IDs the attacker may use join-
   leave attacks to place a malicious peer intentionally at any location
   in overlay.  Placing the peer at any location allows an attacker to
   obtain control of the location in the overlay where the attacked user
   or resource is registered.  A malicious peer may discard, modify the
   data it is supposed to store and may discard lookup requests or reply
   with incorrect entries to the incoming requests.

   The attacker may also try to register a large number of resources to
   the P2PSIP overlay increasing processing load on peers that are
   responsible for storing the resources and limiting the overall
   capacity of the P2PSIP overlay network.  It may also try to register
   all popular names preventing the name holders from registering their
   preferred URIs.

   Another critical point where a D-o-S attack can be mounted is the
   enrollment system.

3.8.  Communication security threats

   The main places where communication security becomes an issue in the
   P2PSIP context is the enrollment process and the communication
   between endpoints.  The last ones are subject to all typical threats
   in this domain, however they have been individually considered in the
   earlier sections of this chapter.

   This document assumes that the actual SIP service implementation
   provides its own communication security, and the P2PSIP adds to that

   only in providing a means for the communication endpoints to
   establish a shared key for further security needs.  Otherwise, the
   communication security threats in that domain is out-of-scope for
   this discussion.

4.  Security Comparison between C/S and P2P

   In a Client Server(C/S) architecture, a client asks for a specific
   service only from a specific server.  The destination contact
   address(i.e. the address of that server) can be acquired from the
   trusted DNS system directly.  Given this, the security issues exist
   only with the connection between the client and the server.
   Typically, making the connection secure between the client and the
   server addresses most of the security issues related to the client.

   However, in a P2P architecture the security issues are more complex.

   First, where in a C/S architecture specific servers provide certain
   services, in a P2P architecture, each peer in the P2P overlay can
   provide distributed storage and transport services for other P2P
   entities.  There is also no hierarchy of servers but instead the
   peers self-organize into the P2P overlay.

   Second, where in a C/S architecture a client sends its request
   directly to a server, in a P2P architecture a peer sends messages
   through Key-Based-Routing and it doesn't know where the destination
   is.  There are intermediate nodes between the source and destination.

   Third, where in a C/S architecture the client can trust the
   information from the server, in a P2P architecture, one peer does not
   know whether it should trust the information acquired from the
   overlay.

   So in a P2P architecture, security issues not only exist between end
   to end entities, but also between hop by hop services.  They are not
   only related to the routing security, but also related to the content
   security.

5.  Security Analysis with P2P Layers

   The overall security of a P2PSIP system depends upon the security of
   each layer of the P2PSIP architecture.  In this section we split the
   P2PSIP architecture into four main layers, as shown in the following
   figure, and analyze the security issues from the P2PSIP architecture
   perspective.

        Figure 2    P2PSIP architecture

   The major components of RELOAD are:

      Usage Layer: Each application defines a RELOAD usage; a set of
      data kinds and behaviors which describe how to use the services
      provided by RELOAD.  These usages all talk to RELOAD through a
      common Message Transport API.

Internet-Draft          P2PSIP Security Overview          September 2009


      Message Transport: Handles the end-to-end reliability, manages
      request state for the usages, and forwards Store and Fetch
      operations to the Storage component.  Delivers message responses
      to the component initiating the request.

      Storage: The Storage component is responsible for processing
      messages relating to the storage and retrieval of data.  It talks
      directly to the Topology Plugin to manage data replication and
      migration, and it talks to the Message Transport to send and
      receive messages.

      Topology Plugin: The Topology Plugin is responsible for
      implementing the specific overlay algorithm being used.  It uses
      the Message Transport component to send and receive overlay
      management messages, to the Storage component to manage data
      replication, and directly to the Forwarding Layer to control hop-
      by-hop message forwarding.  This component closely parallels
      conventional routing algorithms, but is more tightly coupled to
      the Forwarding Layer because there is no single "routing table"
      equivalent used by all overlay algorithms.

      Forwarding and Link Management Layer: Stores and implements the
      routing table by providing packet forwarding services between
      nodes.  It also handles establishing new links between nodes,
      including setting up connections across NATs using ICE.

      Overlay Link Layer: TLS and DTLS are the "link layer" protocols
      used by RELOAD for hop-by-hop communication.  Each such protocol
      includes the appropriate provisions for per-hop framing or hop-by-
      hop ACKs required by unreliable transports.

5.1.  Overlay Link Layer Security

   Given that a P2PSIP overlay can run on top of the Internet or other
   untrusted network, messages between associated nodes should be
   protected against attacks(such as Man-in-the-Middle).  In order to
   establish the identity trust association, nodes must authenticate
   each other with e.g.  TLS and DTLS.  If transport service security is
   provided, we can prevent nodes without valid identities to
   participate in the overlay.  This layer must provides reliable and
   secure hop-by-hop transport service for the P2P overlay.  This alone,
   though, is not enough to secure the P2P system.

5.2.  Forwarding and Link Management Layer Security

   Each Peer in the P2PSIP overlay provides key-based routing service to
   other peers and a routing maintenance mechanism is used to keep the
   routing table timely and correct for the routing service.  There are



Song, et al.              Expires April 1, 2010                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft          P2PSIP Security Overview          September 2009


   some security threats with the routing table updating interaction and
   the key-based routing.

   Even if all the nodes participating in the P2PSIP overlay have valid
   identities, the overlay may still be attacked by responding with fake
   routing table to UPDATE requests.  If the routing table is false, the
   routing determination based on it will be false too.  So,
   verification mechanisms should be adopted to verify if the routing
   table received by the peer correct or not.  A correct routing table
   is important for hop by hop forwarding security.

   Second, some attackers may discard the messages when forwarding, or
   on purpose forward the message to a wrong next hop.  The overlay
   should include some method to detect incorrectly forwarded messages.

   Third, some attacks may cause high churn rate to the overlay.  For
   example, some peers may frequently join and leave the overlay.
   Overlay wastes much more traffic to update the routing table, and
   transfer relative resource objects under churn.  It can also make the
   routing messages fail.

   In this case, we need a method to control nodes joining the overlay.
   The join control entity, which may be a bootstrap server or
   enrollment server, or a bootstrap peer, makes records of peers'
   historical behaviors in the overlay and their historical join
   requests.  When it receives the join request from a peer to join the
   overlay, it checks the historical records as mentioned above to
   determine whether this peer is permitted to join at this point.  It
   will deny the node to join the overlay when it determines the peer is
   not permitted to join.  For example, if a peer joins and leaves too
   frequently, it will be denied to join the overlay as a peer for a
   period of time and instead it will be allowed to join the overlay as
   a client.

   Chosen-ID attack makes the above security issues much more worse.

   In general, the main security issues in this layer are about routing
   table maintenance security, and the the KBR function security.

5.3.  Topology Plugin Security

   The security issues with with this component are rather p2p algorithm
   specific.

5.4.  Storage Security

   The storage component provides distributed storage service for the
   resource objects that located in one's responsible resource ID range,



Song, et al.              Expires April 1, 2010                [Page 17]

Internet-Draft          P2PSIP Security Overview          September 2009


   and the replication service to keep the availability of resource
   objects under churn.  The security issues here are typically end to
   end, and about the content and authority security.

   First, We need to protect resource objects when needed against
   unauthorized data operation such as fetch, modify or remove.  A
   solution for authorization is needed.

   Second, The P2PSIP overlay needs a method to prevent attackers from
   publishing malicious information that will cause a DDOS attack.  For
   example, Peer A may publish a very popular resource record with the
   contact address of Peer B without B's permission.  That causes
   unexpected connections to B which will overload Peer B. Using
   certificates can't solve this problem, a check mechanism for the
   resource object is needed.

   Third, overlays work well for a reasonable amount of resource
   objects, but crash more or less when inserting big number of resource
   objects per node.  Spam attacks can make overlays go down.  Open
   issue: Should spam attack be considered in the storage layer?  Or is
   it only the responsibility of the application layer to handle this
   problem?

   Fourth, for the availability of the resource records in the overlay
   network, replication is needed, but attackers can replicate excessive
   amount of resources in the overlay network.  So, only authorized
   peers can replicate certain resources, and the number of resources
   one can replicate is limited.

5.5.  Message Transport Security

   Some attacker who is not responsible for the destination ID may
   respond to some requests when he is in the intermediate routing
   path(May respond with a fabricated resource object or just says that
   the searched resource object doesn't exist).  Should the source node
   verify whether the response peer is responsible for the request?
   When and how does the source peer do that?  Whether the response peer
   is responsible for the request is important for the end to end
   message transport security.

   Another security issue in this layer is about the message state
   maintenance.  The timeout value for the end to end message transport
   must be chosen appropriately, because too short timeout value will
   cause the overlay be flooded with messages since the initiator will
   send the request again before the response is received.  And too long
   timeout value will not satisfy the requirement for communication
   efficiency when routing failures occur.  An open issue here is: How
   to derive the appropriate timeout value and should the timeout value

   be changed when the overlay size changes?

5.6.  Usage Layer Security

   The SIP usage security analysis is briefly discussed in the Security
   Considerations section of [I-D.ietf-p2psip-sip].

6.  Security Analysis with Application Scenarios

   As mentioned in the security considerations section in the
   application scenarios draft [I-D.bryan-p2psip-app-scenarios], the
   security requirements of the various application scenarios vary
   tremendously.  So in this section, we divide the application
   scenarios into two main types, instead of analyzing all the security
   threats with each specific scenario described in the application
   scenarios draft, we just analyze the relative security threats of
   these two types, which represent most of the likely deployment
   scenarios in the real world.  For example, the "Public P2P VoIP
   Service Providers" scenario in section 4.1.1 of application scenarios
   draft may be deployed using the first type(refer to section 6.1 of
   this specification), and the "Open Global P2P VoIP Network" scenario
   in section 4.1.2 of application scenarios draft may be deployed using
   the second type(refer to section 6.2 of this specification).

6.1.  Trusted P2P Overlay Base

   In a trusted P2P Overlay Base, all the peers are deemed to be
   trustworthy and are assumed to behave in a good manner.  They may be
   deployed to provide reliable and high quality services, and may also
   do some management services for the overlay.  All P2PSIP clients
   access the overlay service through an associated trusted peer, as
   shown in figure 3.

   security issues to be considered are the transport security between
   trusted peers and the security issues associated with clients.
   Security issues also focus on distributed storage layer.

6.2.  Untrusted P2P Overlay Base

   In an untrusted P2P Overlay Base, there are peers who are not trusted
   by other peers.  Some of the untrusted peers may do harmful things or
   abnormal behaviors to the overlay due to malicious or unknown
   intentions.  There may be trusted peers in the overlay, as Shown in
   Figure 5.

   In these scenarios, the security threats with the Trusted P2P Overlay
   Base still exist.  However there are many additional security threats
   because there may exist malicious peers in these networks.  Each
   layer of the P2PSIP architecture and the enrollment may be attacked.
   The attacks beyond those in the Trusted Overlay Base scenarios are
   listed in Figure 6.

7.  Interconnection to other networks

   While some P2PSIP systems may exist that only allow communication
   between P2PSIP peers within the system, other P2PSIP systems may have
   connections to other networks such as the traditional Public Switched
   Telephone Network (PSTN) or newer SIP-based networks.

   For example, a P2PSIP system might be deployed within a branch office
   with a connection from the P2PSIP system going back to a SIP-based
   communication network in a main corporate office.  Alternatively, a
   small office might deploy a P2PSIP system and then have some gateway
   to the PSTN for external communication.

   In examples such as these, care must be taken to ensure the security
   of communication to those external networks.  Note that the level of
   concern may vary depending upon whether the P2PSIP overlay base is
   trusted or untrusted, as discussed in the previous section.

7.1.  Connections to SIP networks

   A common scenario may be for a P2PSIP system to be connected to
   another SIP network.  This could be to a main corporate network as
   described earlier, or it could be to a SIP-based Service Provider who
   would then provide inbound and / or outbound connectivity to the
   PSTN.  It could also be to an on-premise device such as an IP-PBX or
   SIP application server that would provide connectivity to other
   networks.

   Important considerations here include:

   o  How is the P2PSIP overlay network connected to the SIP network?
      Is it through a single designated peer?  Is it through multiple
      peers?

   o  How is the availability of the connection to the SIP network
      preserved?

   o  How susceptible to Denial of Service attacks is the connection?

   o  How are the authentication credentials for the SIP connection
      protected?

   o  What kind of transport security is deployed for the connection?

   o  How are firewall traversal issues addressed?

   Care must be taken that the confidentiality, integrity and
   availability of this connection be maintained.

Internet-Draft          P2PSIP Security Overview          September 2009


7.2.  Direct connections to the PSTN

   While some P2PSIP systems may choose to connect to SIP-based Service
   Providers to achieve PSTN connectivity, others might opt for direct
   connectivity to the PSTN through local gateways such as hardware
   cards.  For instance, a small office might have a PC or other device
   with a hardware card that provided connectivity to a traditional
   analog line to the PSTN.  Similarly, a desk phone may be created with
   both an IP connection and an analog line connection.

   In these cases, one or more of the P2PSIP Peers may have these
   devices installed and may then advertise these resources as being
   available.  Important considerations here include:

   o  How is the availability of the Peer(s) providing the PSTN gateway?

   o  Are there protections in place to ensure that routing tables
      aren't manipulated so that other Peers cannot find the gateways?

8.  Security considerations

   This section describes aspects of security considerations in a P2PSIP
   system.

8.1.  User security considerations

   The user wants available and reliable service that enables him to
   interact with other users and resources in a secure way.  This means
   that the P2PSIP system must provide:

   o  lookup and discovery of users and resources that is secure and
      reliable,

   o  certainty of user and resource identity,

   o  confidentiality and integrity of end-to-end multimedia
      communication,

   o  easy and secure enrollment to the P2PSIP system,

8.2.  System security considerations

   In order for a P2PSIP system to function properly and that the end
   user gets a proper service, there are several aspects that the P2PSIP
   system must take in to account.

8.2.1.  Dependence of reachability of a centralized server

   Considering the nature of P2P in general, the dependence of
   reachability of a centralized server should be minimized.  There may
   be unavoidable situations such as the enrollment process, where this
   is not possible.  However, the normal functioning of the P2PSIP
   overlay such as join and leave operations, modification, retrieval
   and deletion of P2PSIP resource (user) records from the P2PSIP system
   should not depend on the reachability of a centralised server.

8.2.2.  Scalability

   P2PSIP security should scale from a small ad-hoc network to a network
   with hundred millions of network nodes and users.

8.2.3.  Preference of existing security mechanisms

   Although P2PSIP defines a new architecture, and thereby new
   interfaces and protocols, for security there are several standardized
   solutions for access control, authentication, integrity protection
   and communication security.  Using established protocols minimizes



Song, et al.              Expires April 1, 2010                [Page 27]

Internet-Draft          P2PSIP Security Overview          September 2009


   potential security loopholes that need to be patched later.  Besides
   implementation is easier if chosen security protocols are widely
   implemented and used.

8.2.4.  Base P2P security design considerations and guideline

   All of the security operations should be specified in such a way that
   they do not impose new unnecessary requirements on a base P2P
   algorithm (e.g., DHT implementations) and limit its scalability.  The
   security issues that are not introduced by the P2P algorithm must not
   be left to the P2P algorithm to solve.

   A P2PSIP system should provide methods to support various level of
   security provisioning.  Security requirements in P2P systems can be
   different, depending on level of trust in the central entities and
   connectivity to the global Internet.  Security operations should be
   specified in a manner that they do not overload base P2P algorithms
   (e.g.  DHT implementations).  Security risks, not covered by these,
   should be further investigated in research projects.

8.2.5.  Node and user identification

   The P2PSIP system must preserve user and resource identities.  It
   must NOT be possible to steal a P2PSIP identity from another user.

   Because some attackers may try to use identities of another P2PSIP
   network entities it should be possible to verify the identity of
   another party.

8.2.6.  Enrollment

   The enrollment process defines the set of users and P2PSIP network
   entities that may participate in a P2PSIP system.  Each P2PSIP system
   may establish its own policy for who can join the system.  The
   enrollment process policy may define:

   o  how many and what user IDs and peer IDs a user or a P2PSIP network
      entity may register,

   o  and how often they must re-new their subscription to the P2PSIP
      system.

   As it was indicated in [I-D.bryan-p2psip-requirements] the enrollment
   process may take several measures in admitting a user or a network
   node to the P2PSIP system to increase security:






Song, et al.              Expires April 1, 2010                [Page 28]

Internet-Draft          P2PSIP Security Overview          September 2009


   o  may require strong identity such as employment or identity
      provided by a trusted 3rd party or by the P2PSIP service operator,

   o  may apply reputation mechanisms.

   Although the user probably is the entity that enrolls to the P2PSIP
   system, the credentials that are the result of the enrollment are
   used to grant a device the right to function as a peer, client or any
   other operative function possible in the system.  Thus the security
   of enrollment also translates to the security of the device itself
   where the credentials are stored, and threats related to device
   security in general.

8.2.7.  Replay attacks

   An attacker should not be able to repeat or delay valid data
   transmission during enrollment and modification of P2PSIP resource
   (user) records in a P2PSIP overlay.

8.2.8.  Unauthorized data access

   An attacker must NOT be able to easily corrupt, delete, or overwrite
   other user's or resource's data stored in P2PSIP resource (user)
   records as well as routing tables.  Only authorized users must be
   able to modify, delete or overwrite their P2PSIP resource (user)
   records in the P2PSIP system.  P2PSIP security should allow users and
   P2PSIP network entities to register the same resources (e.g.
   TURN@overlay.net), however each entity should have rights only to its
   own part of a resource record.  In other words each entity should be
   able to perform the same operations on its part of a resource record
   as on its own resource (user) records.

   The owner of the P2PSIP resource (user) records should be able to
   authorize other users and network entities to modify, delete their
   P2PSIP resource (user) records.

8.2.9.  Data validation

   First and foremost it must be possible to verify that the data stored
   in or retrieved from the P2PSIP overlay is authentic, i.e. was not
   tampered by unauthorized P2PSIP network entities.

   The peer that stores P2PSIP resource (user) records must be able to
   validate the data received in the process of P2PSIP resource (user)
   record insertion and modification.

Internet-Draft          P2PSIP Security Overview          September 2009


8.2.10.  Denial of Service (DOS) attacks

   It must NOT be possible to obtain control of the location in the
   overlay where the attacked user's or resource's records are
   registered.  In order to prevent so-called Sybil or join-leave
   attacks the attacker should NOT be able to easily register a
   unlimited number of IDs of his choice in the P2SIP overlay.  The
   P2PSIP system should be able to control ID assignment.  Once
   assigned, an ID or a set of IDs should be difficult to change.

   In addition the P2PSIP architecture should make sure that data stored
   in a P2PSIP overlay is persistent, meaning that even if a number of
   nodes (but not all of nodes in the overlay) fails the data stored by
   those nodes is not lost.  In addition the attacker must NOT be able
   to register unlimited number of resources in the overlay.

8.2.11.  Privacy Protection

   The security of P2PSIP systems must guarantee privacy of the P2PSIP
   network participants.  The P2PSIP security should allow the users and
   P2PSIP network entities to indicate which other users or P2PSIP
   network entities can retrieve, modify, and delete data stored in
   their P2PSIP resource (user) records.  The owner of a P2PSIP resource
   (user) record should be able to limit the access to his own resource
   (user) records, and this feature should be enforced by the P2P
   network.

   It must also be difficult to monitor who is communicating with a
   particular user, or retrieve any contextual data about the user
   without the user's explicit consent.  The P2PSIP network entities
   must be provided with option to encrypt data exchanged with other
   P2PSIP network entities.

8.2.12.  Badly behaving nodes

   It should be possible to limit potential damage caused by
   malfunctioning and badly behaving nodes in a P2PSIP system.  As the
   policy taken by the P2PSIP system operator/community may be very
   liberal, any user can obtain the right to be a user of a P2PSIP
   system.  It may be that some users behave badly intentionally in
   which case it should be possible to limit the impact of the badly
   behaving nodes on the overall system security.  There should be
   methods to look for badly behaving nodes and exclude or reject them
   from the P2PSIP system.

   o  The document is synchronized with the recently released updates to
      the RELOAD protocol as documented by editor Bruce Lowekamp in
      [I-D.ietf-p2psip-sip] and [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base]

   o  The merge between the two previous documents is completed and the
      text flows better.

   o  A section will be added on security requirements related to
      interconnection of P2PSIP networks to other networks including
      non-P2P SIP networks and the PSTN.

   o  A subsection about SIP usage security has been created.

   o  Various wording changes based on comments from Christian Schmidt.
