Internet-Draft     SIP Usage Scenarios Similar to SPIT         July 2008


1.  Author's Note

   After review in the RUCUS mailing list, it was determined that this
   document should be folded into a larger document, most likely either
   the existing RUCUS problem statement or another yet-to-be-created
   document on a reference scenario.  Given that direction by the
   mailing list, this will most likely be the final submission of this
   document as a standalone document.

   While this document may be folded into a larger document in the
   future, comments and feedback are definitely welcome.


2.  Introduction

   If the administrator of a VoIP network suddenly noticed 10,000
   outbound SIP INVITE messages traversing the network in the space of a
   minute or two, could this be a spammer generating voice spam on the
   network?  Or could this be the legitimate triggering of an emergency
   notification system?

   As outlined in the recently published RFC 5039 [RFC5039],
   communication using the Session Iniatiation Protocol (SIP) could be a
   target for a form of spam commonly known as either "voice spam",
   "Spam for Internet Telephony" or simply "SPIT".  Essentially, SPIT is
   the transmission of bulk unsolicited messages via SIP.  It is
   telemarketing brought to the world of IP where the traditional costs
   and delays associated with telemarketing in the PSTN world are
   removed.  Telemarketers can now very rapidly and inexpensively send
   out a very high volume of calls, which we might see as "spam".  For
   reasons outlined in RFC 5039, SPIT attacks are not yet widely seen,
   but can be expected as further interconnections occur between SIP
   systems.

   RFC 5039 and related Internet Drafts
   ([I-D.tschofenig-sipping-framework-spit-reduction] and
   [I-D.niccolini-sipping-spitstop]) outline the potential threat of
   SPIT and also lay out suggestions for possible solutions.  Beyond the
   potential solutions offered thus far, it is very conceivable that
   traditional network security vendors will seek to use existing tools
   to combat SPIT at a network traffic level.  For instance, a system
   designed to monitor network traffic and trigger alerts based on
   anomolies seen in network traffic could be modified to look for
   anomolies in the base rate of SIP traffic.

   The purpose of this document is to provide input into the ongoing
   discussions around preventing SPIT that highlights the fact that
   there are cases where legitimate SIP traffic may in fact look like

Internet-Draft     SIP Usage Scenarios Similar to SPIT         July 2008


   SPIT.  If the administrator of a VoIP network suddenly noticed 10,000
   outbound SIP INVITE messages traversing the network in the space of a
   minute or two, this could be SPIT being generated by a system
   connected to that VoIP network - or it could be an emergency
   notification system.

   Solutions to the potential problem of SPIT do need to take into
   account that some legitimate uses of SIP communication might resemble
   the launch of a SPIT session or indeed might resemble a Denial of
   Service (DoS) attack.  This document outlines some of those
   scenarios.

   It should be noted that most of the solutions suggested thus far
   within the IETF to address the issue of SPIT do not use behaviorial
   techniques that may run into the issues addressed in this draft.
   However, as noted earlier, it is to be expected that other solutions
   will be put forward by vendors, some of which may use techniques that
   do not work well with the scenarios listed here.  It is primarily for
   those solutions that this draft is aimed.

   It should also be noted that the concern addressed in this document
   is for the spammer who may generate a large amount of SIP traffic in
   a short period of time and thus potentially come to the attention of
   network monitoring tools.  This may be the case, for instance, when a
   spammer connects to another party's network (for instance, one using
   unprotected WiFi) and wants to send out the most messages in the
   least amount of time.  A spammer may also simply be trying to send
   the messages out as fast as possible for one client in order to move
   on to other clients.

   Obviously a spammer could simply slow down the rate of sending SIP
   messages to evade this type of detection.  In that case the SPIT
   traffic would resemble normal SIP traffic and be subject to the
   concerns and potential solutions suggested in RFC 5039 and other
   Internet-Drafts.

   NOTE: Reflecting the fact that SIP can be used for far more than
   voice, RFC 5039 discusses call spam, IM spam and presence spam.  This
   document, however, primarily focuses on call spam.


3.  Outbound SIP Scenarios

   Given the ease with which SIP systems can be connected to existing
   applications such as databases, creating a system to do large scale
   initiation of SIP messages is easy to do and both commercial and open
   source implementations of such functionality exist today.




York                    Expires January 15, 2009                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     SIP Usage Scenarios Similar to SPIT         July 2008


   Any system that generated a large amount of outbound SIP traffic
   might potentially be viewed as a generator of SPIT.  This section
   breaks down those systems into several categories.

3.1.  Emergency Notification Systems

   In the wake of recent school shootings in the USA, particularly the
   April 2007 event at Virginia Tech, academic institutions at all
   levels are seeking technical solutions which will allow them to do
   "emergency notification" on a massive scale.  Such systems can be
   triggered by school administrators or potentially public safety
   officials and immediately begin notifying students, faculty and now
   even parents.  Notification may take the form of phone calls, text
   messages (SMS), IM messages or all of the above.

   Were such a system to be SIP-based, the triggering of the system
   might result in the immediate flow of:

   o  SIP INVITE messages to phones, conceivably to every known SIP
      endpoint on the campus

   o  SIP messages to PSTN gateways to initiate outbound calls to
      regular phones

   o  SIP messages to SMS gateways to initiate outbound text messages

   o  SIP messages to IM networks

   If a university were to have, for instance, 10,000 students and
   several thousand more staff and faculty, an extremely large number of
   SIP messages would be sent in a very short time.

   It is important to note that in the case of an emergency notification
   system, messages are typically extremely time-sensitive and are
   looking for immediate delivery.  There also may be health, legal or
   at least public relations ramifications if the messages are blocked
   from delivery.  There will also typically be no notification of the
   triggering of such a system and, hopefully, the system will almost
   never be used.  To the unaware system administrator just routinely
   monitoring network traffic, this would be an extremely surprising
   event.

   Beyond usage in educational settings, emergency notification systems
   like this are also be established in a variety of other situations
   such as government alerts about impending weather or natural events
   (ex. tornados, fires).

Internet-Draft     SIP Usage Scenarios Similar to SPIT         July 2008


3.2.  Urgent Notification Systems

   While not rising to the same level of criticality as "emergency"
   systems, there are other "urgent" notification systems that follow a
   similar profile.  Examples include:

   o  Airline systems notifying travelers of delayed or cancelled
      flights

   o  School systems notifying families of school delays or
      cancellations

   o  Stock price change notifications

   Again, the notification system may trigger on an infrequent basis or
   go through seasonal cycles and may involve a large number of calls.
   In some situations, such as a school notification, the number of
   calls may be close to the same in each event.  For example, the
   number of student families to notify may fluctuate slightly but
   typically not by much.  In other situations the number of calls may
   vary widely.  For example, the number of calls to be made by an
   airline notification system may depend upon how many people are
   traveling and how many of those travelers provided contact
   information or requested to be notified..

3.3.  Event-Driven Notification Systems

   In a similar fashion to the previous scenarios, it is quite
   conceivable that automated systems will be used by a wide variety of
   organizations to alert people to impending events.  For instance, a
   professional sports team might use a system to alert all the members
   of a fan club about an upcoming game.  A business group might remind
   all of its members about an upcoming conference.  A political
   campaign might call a list reminding people to go out and vote.  The
   list of potential users of such a system could be quite lengthy.
   Some examples might be:

   o  Professional sports teams

   o  School events

   o  Local theatres

   o  Business groups

   o  Town/city governments/associations





York                    Expires January 15, 2009                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     SIP Usage Scenarios Similar to SPIT         July 2008


   o  Political campaigns

   The key element here is that the calls might happen on an infrequent
   basis.  There might be a large number of calls made in a short period
   of time - and once the event is over there are no more calls made by
   that entity until the next similar event.

3.4.  Routine Notification Systems

   While the previous scenarios have outlined situations where a large
   amount of traffic was generated with no warning, there also exist a
   class of scenarios where a large amount of traffic might be generated
   on a regular interval.  For instance, some school systems in the USA
   are starting to use notification systems to alert parents to events
   that have occurred that day or will be occurring.  They might receive
   a phone call each day stating what homework their child had and/or
   informing them of a school meeting occuring later in the week.  With
   a large school district, the automated notification system might
   initiate thousands of calls every day at, for example, 3pm.

   Similarly, a movie theater might call every subscriber in a special
   promotional club on every Thursday afternoon to let them know what
   movies might be premiering during the upcoming weekend.

   Again, there are a large number of potential users of such a system.
   The key difference in this scenario is that the traffic may occur at
   a regular time and period.  Security systems that monitor network
   traffic might flag these notification systems as potential sources of
   SPIT but conceivably those systems could be configured in such a way
   that this notification traffic is incorporated into a network
   "baseline" as known and expected traffic.


4.  Inbound SIP Scenarios

   In a similar fashion to outbound SIP scenarios, it is possible that
   sufficient legitimate inbound traffic to a SIP system/network might
   cause administrators or automated systems to believe they are
   receiving a large amount of voice spam/SPIT.  For instance, if a
   system were on the receiving end of an emergency notification system
   (ex. an IP-PBX operated by a department within a university) a high
   level of SIP INVITE messages would be received that might go to all
   extensions on the system.

   Similarly, the system/network might be receiving calls due to a
   contest or other event (ex. an "American Idol"-type of show where
   people call in and vote or a radio station contest).  Note, though,
   that in this situation the calls might be coming in from a range of



York                    Expires January 15, 2009                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     SIP Usage Scenarios Similar to SPIT         July 2008


   different endpoints and could also resemble a Denial of Service (DoS)
   or Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) attack.

   The primary difference from outbound scenarios is that with the
   inbound scenario the destination of all the traffic would typically
   be the SIP proxy/gateway for a given network.  Again, this may make
   differentiation between legitimate traffic and SPIT - or a DoS or
   DDoS - difficult.

4.1.

   Similar to the Event-Driven outbound systems, there may be legitimate
   inbound calling due to specific *known* events.  Examples include:

   o  "American Idol"-style TV shows

   o  Radio station listener contests, ticket giveaways, etc.

   o  Interview shows (Ex.  "Call now to ask your mayor questions about
      the school budget.")

   o  Advertising (Ex.  "Call in the next 5 minutes to obtain your copy
      of ____ for only $19.95!")

   The major distinction here is that at some point it is known that
   this traffic will be generated, in comparison to the section below.
   For instance, the time when callers may be calling in to vote in the
   TV show will be known in advance.  (Whether or not all systems in the
   path of the call will be alerted to this is a separate matter.)

4.2.

   Unexpected events such as those that might cause a significant amount
   of outbound calling (as outlined in the Emergency Notification
   Systems earlier) may also create a significant amount of *inbound*
   calling.  Such events include, but are certainly not limited to, such
   things as:

   o  Natural disasters

   o  School shootings

   o  Large traffic accidents

   o  Bombings

   Again the issue here is that these events are entirely unexpected and
   therefore the traffic entering a SIP network could very easily be



York                    Expires January 15, 2009                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     SIP Usage Scenarios Similar to SPIT         July 2008


   viewed as a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack.


5.  Network Failures

   Another scenario to consider is the case where excessive amounts of
   SIP traffic are not the result of exceptional amounts of inbound or
   outbound calling but rather a failure in the actual network
   infrastructure.  For instance, consider the case where there is a
   wide area network with multiple SIP-to-PSTN gateways and a large
   distributed infrastructure.  An outage at specific points in the
   network might result in all the traffic for the larger network being
   routed through a single SIP signaling node.  To the administrators of
   that node, the sudden influx of additional traffic might cause
   concern of a DoS or SPIT attack.  One might hope that the
   administrators would also be able to easily ascertain the network
   status and understand why they are receiving this traffic, but that
   might not be possible in all network configurations.


6.  Other Considerations

   One logical reaction to these scenarios might be to suggest that the
   legitimate senders simply reduce their send rate to be below any
   timing thresholds that might trigger automated systems.  For
   instance, if a system needing to contact 10,000 endpoints were to
   send one SIP INVITE every half-second, the INVITEs would then all go
   out over the space of a bit under 1.5 hours.  For some systems, such
   the "Routine Notification Systems" identified earlier, spacing out
   the INVITE messages might be fine and in fact might actually be
   required in order for the media servers to keep with streaming the
   outbound media to all the invited endpoints.  However, in other
   situations, such as emergency notification systems, some spacing out
   of INVITE messages may be possible but at some threshold any further
   delays may be unacceptable and indeed in some cases could be life-
   threatening.


7.  Summary

   Voice spam, also known as "SPIT", has the potential to be a serious
   problem if we move to a space where we have interconnected systems
   where any SIP endpoint can call any other SIP endpoint - and we do
   not have any mechanisms in place to prevent abuse of the system to
   generate large volumes of unsolicited calls.  Solutions are being
   discussed and such work needs to be continued.

   In looking at potential solutions, it is important to recognize that



York                    Expires January 15, 2009                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft     SIP Usage Scenarios Similar to SPIT         July 2008


   there are legitimate cases where SIP systems may generate large
   volumes of calls in a rapid timeframe.  Any solutions to addressing
   the problem of SPIT do need to take into account these legitimate
   scenarios.
