This repository contains Internet-Drafts that I am involved with writing or editing.

The main directory contains the I-Ds that I am currently actively editing.

I include both the .txt file that is submitted to the IETF datatracker and also the original XML file 
in case the XML file may be useful to others who are writing Internet-Drafts (and for my own tracking).

The "archive" directory contains older drafts I worked on, including (as of December 2011):

* draft-matuszewski-p2psip-security-overview-00.xml   (Sept 28, 2009)
* draft-matuszewski-p2psip-security-requirements-05.xml  (July 10, 2009)
* draft-york-sip-visual-identifier-trusted-identity-01.xml  (Nov 3, 2008)
* draft-york-sipping-spit-similarity-scenarios-01.xml  (July 14, 2008)

draft-york-sipping-p-charge-info-10.xml is also in the archive folder to maintain the commit history
of previous versions of p-charge-info.  I was using "git mv" to rename the ID up to -10, and then for 
some reason made a new version -11 (which was then renamed to -12 and -13, etc.)
